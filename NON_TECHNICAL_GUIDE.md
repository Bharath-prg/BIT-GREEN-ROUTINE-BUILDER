## 🌈 Common Questions

### "What if I miss a day?"

No problem! Your streak resets, but your eco score stays. Start a new streak tomorrow. Progress isn't linear!

### "How many habits should I have?"

Start with 1-2. Experienced users typically maintain 3-5. More than 10 can be overwhelming.

### "What's the best way to build a streak?"

Start with one very easy habit you already do (like using a reusable mug). Build from there.

### "Can I pause a challenge?"

Not currently. If life gets busy, focus on easier challenges or just track habits without challenges.

### "What if I want to delete a habit?"

You can! But if you're in an active challenge with that habit, you'll be asked if you want to delete both.

### "Can I use this on my phone?"

Yes! The website works on any device with a browser. Just bookmark it on your phone's home screen.

### "Do I need to check in every day?"

For best results, yes! But you can also log multiple days at once if you miss logging.

### "What happens to my data?"

It's stored securely and privately. Only you can see your habits and progress (unless you opt into the leaderboard).

### "Can I turn off email reminders?"

Absolutely! Go to Profile → Settings → Toggle "Email Reminders" off.

### "Is there a cost?"

Check with the app administrator. The app may be free or have subscription options.

## 🌍 Environmental Impact

### Understanding Your Impact

While eco points are gamified, they represent real environmental benefits:

**Low Impact (10 pts)** - Small but important changes

- Example: Turning off lights = ~0.1 kg CO₂ saved
- Annual impact: ~36 kg CO₂

**Medium Impact (25 pts)** - Meaningful daily changes

- Example: Reusable bag = ~0.25 kg CO₂ saved
- Annual impact: ~91 kg CO₂

**High Impact (50 pts)** - Significant environmental wins

- Example: Biking vs driving = ~2.5 kg CO₂ saved per trip
- Annual impact: ~900 kg CO₂

### Real-World Equivalents

**1,000 eco points** ≈ Planting 5 trees
**5,000 eco points** ≈ Saving 1,000 plastic bottles
**10,000 eco points** ≈ Preventing 500 kg CO₂ emissions

_Note: These are approximate estimates for motivation. Actual impact varies._

## 🌱 Building Long-Term Habits

### The Science Behind the App

**21-Day Myth:**
While popular culture says it takes 21 days to form a habit, research shows it actually takes 66 days on average. That's why the app offers a 60-Day Challenge!

**Consistency Over Perfection:**
Missing one day doesn't erase your progress. What matters is getting back on track quickly.

**Small Changes, Big Impact:**
One person doing many things imperfectly makes more impact than waiting to do everything perfectly.

### From App to Lifestyle

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Conscious Effort**

- Need reminders and tracking
- Requires willpower
- Feels like work

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Becoming Routine**

- Starting to feel automatic
- Less reliance on reminders
- Easier to remember

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9+): Automatic Behavior**

- Don't even think about it
- Feels weird NOT to do it
- True habit formation

**The App's Role:**

- Guides you through all three phases
- Provides structure during Phase 1
- Motivates through Phase 2
- Validates you've reached Phase 3

---
